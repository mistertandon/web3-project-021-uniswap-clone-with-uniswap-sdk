# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

npm i @uniswap/v3-periphery
npm i @openzeppelin/contracts
npm i ether
npm in web3modal
npm i hardhat-tracer

 > npx hardhat clean
 > npx hardhat compile
 > npx hardhat test --trace

 > npx hardhat node
 > npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

 Note: npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@3.4.2 must be used in order to get contract compiled correctly.
